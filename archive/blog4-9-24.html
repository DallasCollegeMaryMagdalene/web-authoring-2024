            <h4>Summary of Video Content</h4>
            <p>In this video Kevin shows viewers how to use an attribute called srcset to help them load in different versions of the same image based on the size of the user's viewport. Working in this way is beneficial for reducing bandwidth for users on lower end devices while ensuring that users on high-end devices get nice, crisp images. One might expect that doubling the size of an image would double the bandwidth, when in fact, doubling an image more than quadrouples the bandwidth required. If an image is 3x larger, nearly 10x more bandwidth is required.  </p>
            <p>Step one for using srcset, simply use srcset command and in quotations provide the images that you would like to use with values separated by commas.  It is important to leave img src attribute, as 90% of browsers will support srcset, but as of the publication date of video, 10% still do not. You will want to make sure have a src attribute to fall back on in case of browser lack of functionality. Make sure to put the lowest quality image in the src to keep bandwidth low.</p>
            <p>Step two for using srcset differs based on which approach you use to styling your image. In css, if you have a fixed width set for your image, you follow the directions in this paragraph. If you don't, skip to the next paragraph.  First, input the different viewport options before the comma after each image name. In the olden days of computing, one css pixel was the same as one hardware pixel, the little dotted light on the screen that you can't see because its too small.  Nowadays, Apple offers retina display in 2x format, which renders each css pixel as four dots.  Then came the 3x, where each pixel is rendered as a 3X3, or 9 hardware pixels. If you are following this method, input nothing after the small image, as we assume its 1x quality.  Input 2x after the larger image, and 3x after the largest.</p>
            <p>Step two for using srcset if you are not using a fixed width in css is to input the actual pixel width after the image file name in your srcset attribute.  Kevin uses the example of 500w after the first image, 1000w after the second, and 1500w after the third. It may be different than what you have seen in the past, but it has to be the width of the image followed by a w. The idea here is that the browser loads only the image you need for the best rendering in your browser.  A benefit to using this way is that you don't have to worry about the device the image is being served on. The browser will choose the best possible option based on the browser and the size of the image. </p>
            <p>If after you complete steps one and two you are interested in taking your work a step further, you can use media queries in your markup. This will require the use of css, which is out of scope for today's review.  Stay tuned for the next blog post.</p>
            <h4>Reviewer Commentary</h4>
            <p>I chose the article as a top resource not only because the content is useful, but also because the presenter is engaging and very gifted at simplifying a concept that could otherwise be confusing. Kevin uses a relaxed teaching style to provide instruction on image optimization. Moreover, his examples are relatable to all types of viewers. </p>

            <h4>Summary of Article Content</h4>
            <p>The About Us page is a very important page for any company’s website, as it gives visitors a glimpse into what working with you might be like to work with you and your team, along with the structure of your company, its culture, it personal stories and photos.</p>
            <p>The author suggests one follow these 6 steps to make a great About Us page.  First, start with the mission statement.  Second, outline your company’s story. Third, share how your company has evolved. Fourth, state any AHA! moments your company may have had.  Fifth, explain who you serve, what you’re offering and how you’ve served other clients in these ways. Lastly describe your company values.</p>
            <p>When one gets comes to the place where they are ready for designing the About Us page, they must first choose the right color scheme to create creative visuals. Choose the right staff photos, use readable fonts, avoid long paragraphs and sentences. Make the page responsive and focus on low load time.</p>
            <p>The author then gives a few places where developers can find sandard layouts for About Us pages that can be used for free, such as her company HubSpot.  This site offers already done for you website templates that can be installed in customized in a few minutes.</p>

The article culminates with 27 really nice looking examples of the author’s favorite About Us pages.</p>
            <h4>Reviewer Commentary</h4>
            <p>I first saw this article in Web Tools class.  Over the year and a half that I have been studying web development, I have reviewed many articles, videos, and paid online courses.  This article is the one I have come back to the most.  I think probably because of its liberal use of external examples.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>This article introduces the importance of taking a hard stance at protecting and securing information, since we are as a society using web applications for so many things and also passing around so much sensitive information via many types of online channels. The article offers 11 tips to improve the overall quality of web applications. </p>
            <p>First, the author emphasizes the need to maintain security during the web app development phase and not to wait until the site is done and then hire a security consulting group to retroactively input security measures.Second tip is  “be paranoid!”  Make sure you require checks and validation of all input. The author offers up the idea to consider all input to be hostile until proven. Also, he suggests the input validation be executed so that only properly formed data passes through the workflow of a web application. The three types of data validation that the author mentions is data type validation, data, format, validation, and data value validation, but basically he says to keep in mind that you need to validate inputs with both syntactical and semantic approaches. The third tip is “encrypt your data!” Encryption is the most common way of protecting sensitive information. Hackers have shown increasingly smarter algorithms that can find penetrable networks rather painlessly.</p>
            <p>Fourth, the author tells us to use exception management that contains only a generic error message. Using actual systems verbatim can put too much information into the wrong hands. The fifth tip is to apply authentication role management and access control. Even better would be to re-authenticate users when accessing more sensitive features.  Basically, each user should be given as little privilege as possible for them to get what they need from the system.   Using this principle (called minimalism by some) you vastly reduce the chance an intruder can perform operations that could crash the application or platform.</p>
            <p>Six is to employ all possible hosting focused measures.  Tip seven is to avoid security misconfiguration in the first place. Commonplace errors here are not protecting files, not removing guest or temporary accounts from web server, using old or defunct software libraries, using outdated security level protocols, and allowing digital certificates to expire.  Make sure to put in place a well documented process for not only setting up new websites but also for setting up web servers and the software to serve those websites.</p>
            <p>Tip eight is implement HTTPS and redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS encryption at the service level. SSL is a technology used to establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser this ensures that the information pass remains private.  SSL is the industry standard for protecting online transactions. Nine include auditing and logging. The author says that much of this is built into the content serving web software applications, such as IIS Internet information services and is readily accessible. Should you need to review various activity related information this is different than error, logging activity or audit logging, and it shouldn’t require set up too much because it’s usually built into the web server software. Tip Ten is to use rigorous quality assurance and testing. If possible, if you use the third-party specializing in penetration testing or vulnerability scanning.  The author suggests its better to be overly cautious and add another layer of testing to catch. The final tip is to stay on top of the security game. Cyber security can be like an arms race, and you need to make sure your team keeps up with evolving threats and tactics.</p>
            <h4>Reviewer Commentary</h4>
            <p>I am interested in web development for commercial clients.  In order to better serve those clients, I want to make sure I have all my ducks in a row when it comes to process and security. In addition to that, I was struck by a particular quote the author used: <q>An open unsecured network is a hackers best friend.” - Jedd Jones</q> I also enjoyed how the author compared cyber security to an arms race and the need to keep pace with your opponents.</p>

            <a href="https://www.classicinformatics.com/blog/the-future-of-web-development#:~:text=AI%2Dbased%20web%20developers%20let,through%20the%20manual%20testing%20phases.">Read Full Article</a>

            <p>People are on the internet at all times, jumping from one application to another so apps and websites hold a lot of importance in today’s world. AI can help developers to improve their web apps and websites for users.  Using intelligent algorithms and machines we can create a stunning website from scratch or improvise an existing one in a few minutes.</p>
            <p>AI has been around as a tool for a while. The primary function of AI is to arouse human cognitive processes, enabling machines to think and execute like humans.  While AI has been used to do more basic stuff such as analyzing data, it now has transformed the user experience of websites.  And it has been leveraged in start up businesses to increase the chances of success and help measure ROI.</p>
            <p>The article names five roles in web development for AI.  First is automation.  AI automation saves developers from doing long and boring coding tasks and cuts coding by generating code, snippets, and modules. For instance, a code that an average developer writes in 20 minutes with AI code, it can be done in half the time with better results. The second role is personalization, meaning AI helps websites suggest content that matches what users like, making and engaging making the website more engaging. The third role of AI is optimization.  For example, AI can help you can create an appealing logo. An example was given of Murf, with is a system that provides ready to use website templates. Fourthly, AI is used in security.  With the growing number of data breeches, security is essential.Last but not least, accessibility is mentioned.  AI will let you create an all inclusive web experience for users regardless of their disabilities.  Text to speech, for example, can help people understand content.  Also AI generated captions are helpful for people who can’t hear.</p>
            <p>There are both advantages and disadvantages of AI and wealth development. Some of the advantages are that developers have to spend less time in front of screens to create simple websites.  With AI’s help, the basic tasks are taken care of and the developers are freed up to focus on other aspects of the website. They also don’t have to go through their code multiple times to identify all bugs.  Moreover, developers canal use generative AI to develop new products and services.  Finally, quality control engineers can easily ensure their code performs that its best without having to go through manual testing phases.</p>
            <p>One of the major disadvantages of AI in web development is that it still doesn’t replace human creativity.  AI’s thinking is limited to what developers have programmed it to be able to do.  Sometimes AI generated responses are biased.  Using biased responses results in unfair and inappropriate decisions. Without human intervention therefore to mitigate AI weaknesses, we must have human monitoring.  Finally, over-reliance on a machine can sometimes result in big blunders in website, interface or Customer Support, which could damage a brand and affect a company’s sales negatively.</p>
            <h4>Reviewer Commentary</h4>
            <p>I chose this article as a top resource because it has a very positive outlook on AI.  Too many times I see people falling into the trap of worrying about how things will negatively impact them and their loved ones.  I loved reading how the author plans to leverage AI to enhance their development work.  </p>
